# The Creality K1 and K1 Max Community Technical Manual Project

This repository will ultimately contain community written
technical documentation for Creality's K1 and K1 Max 3D
printers.

The goal is to have as complete a set of manuals covering everything,
from the physical design of the printers, to the electronics, to all
software, to important operating best practices, community developed
printer modifications and improvements, and more.

Please contribute:

* Markdown files containing documentation on any useful topic that
  isn't currently covered.
* Labeled photographs of important components of the machine.
* Markdown files containing links to important online source outside
  of this repository, including Youtube videos, tutorials, official
  documentation, etc.
* Anything else that you believe would be of widespread use. 

## Why is documentation important?

Documentation is a force multiplier, and community maintained
documentation is doubly so.

Without documentation, people trying to use or modify a system have to
wade through large numbers of sources and waste time. When new things
people discover aren't documented in a place others can find, those
things are lost, or others spend additional time rediscovering them.

Well documented systems get lots of users and lots of
improvements. Help us improve this document.
