# The Creality K1 and K1 Max Community Technical Manual Project

This repository will ultimately contain community written
technical documentation for Creality's K1 and K1 Max 3D
printers.

The goal is to have as complete a set of manuals covering everything,
from the physical design of the printers, to the electronics, to all
software, to important operating best practices, community developed
printer modifications and improvements, and more.

Please contribute:

* Markdown files containing documentation on any useful topic that
  isn't currently covered.
* Labeled photographs of important components of the machine.
* Markdown files containing links to important online source outside
  of this repository, including Youtube videos, tutorials, official
  documentation, etc.
* Anything else that you believe would be of widespread use.
