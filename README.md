# K1TechManual

The Creality K1 and K1 Max Community Technical Manual

This repository will ultimately contain community written
technical documentation for the Creality K1 and K1 Max 3D
printers.

The goal is to have as complete a set of manuals covering
everything from the physical design of the printers to the controllers
and software as possible.
